- `fix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates

### Workflow

1. **Create a new branch** from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull upstream develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly

4. **Commit your changes** with descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new evaluation metric for temporal consistency"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:

6. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- Check existing issues first to avoid duplicates
- Use the bug report template
- Include:
  - Clear description of the bug

  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - System information (OS, Node.js version, etc.)
  - Error messages and stack traces

### Suggesting Features

- Explain the problem your feature solves
- Describe your proposed solution
- Consider alternatives you've thought about

### Code Contributions

Types of contributions we welcome:

- **Bug fixes**: Fix reported issues
- **Features**: Add new functionality
- **Performance**: Optimize existing code
- **Documentation**: Improve or add documentation
- **Tests**: Add missing tests or improve coverage
- **Refactoring**: Improve code quality

### Documentation

- Update documentation for any changed functionality

- Include examples where helpful
- Keep README files up to date

## Coding Standards


### TypeScript/JavaScript Code Style

For frontend code:

```typescript
// Good example
export function VideoComparison({ 
  comparisonId, 
  onComplete 
}: VideoComparisonProps): JSX.Element {
  const [scores, setScores] = useState<DimensionScores>({});
  
  // Implementation
}
```

Tools:
- Use ESLint: `npm run lint`
- Use Prettier: `npm run format`
- Follow Next.js conventions

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

Examples:
```
feat(evaluation): add inter-rater reliability calculation
fix(frontend): resolve video sync issues in Safari
docs(api): update endpoint documentation
```

## Testing


### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd eval/frontend

# Run tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Test Guidelines

- Write descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Keep tests focused and isolated
- Aim for >80% code coverage

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- All public functions/classes need documentation
- Use TypeScript types/interfaces
- Include usage examples for complex features

### User Documentation

- Update relevant README files
- Add to user guides if needed
